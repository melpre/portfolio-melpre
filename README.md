My 6th project: My Portfolio of Projects Site

This web app is a portfolio of projects completed on the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree course. This project uses Node.js and Express to import required dependencies, link JSON to Pug templates, set up routes to handle requests, employ middleware to utilize static files such as CSS, handle errors and set up a server to serve the project.
