            | Hey there prospective employer! Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. I live in California with my husband and two young kids (ages 3 and 5). I have been interested in web development since 2011 and finally made the career jump!
            | Before entering the world of coding, I worked at Bonhams auction house in Advertising and then on to Public Relations, but soon realized I yearned for that coding life when I became involved in my company's launch of their new website.
            | When I am not busy plugging away at some application, I enjoy spending time with my family doing things outdoors.
